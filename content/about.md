# About me

Hey there, my name is Quentin, and I'm a self-declared professional CTF Struggler (meaning I play a lot of CTFs and struggle with them). Do explore around my website to read about my CTF journey!

I work as a Security Engineer for [Ascenda Loyalty Pte Ltd](https://www.ascendaloyalty.com/) and I occassionally write blogposts like this one about [Data exfiltration via DNS tunnelling](https://loyalty.dev/posts/data-exfiltration-via-dns-tunneling) there too! Do check us out! :)
