      <description>Slay the Dragon Challenge Description This was a pwn challenge and also the first challenge of the recent TISC 2022 CTF organised by CSIT. TISC 2022 was an individual CTF that is level-based and not exactly a typical jeopardy-style CTF, meaning that only 1 challenge is released at a time and only after you solve that 1 challenge do you unlock the next one. In this writeup, I will discuss my approach towards solving this particular pwn challenge.</description>
