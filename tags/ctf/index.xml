      <description>Palindrome&amp;rsquo;s Secret Challenge Description This was a Web challenge unlocked at level 5 that was part of the recent TISC 2022 CTF organised by CSIT. TISC 2022 was an individual CTF that is level-based and not exactly a typical jeopardy-style CTF, meaning that only 1 challenge is released at a time and only after you solve that 1 challenge do you unlock the next one. In this writeup, I will discuss my approach towards solving this particular web challenge.</description>

      <description>DuperSuperSafe Challenge Description This was a smart-contract challenge that was part of the recent SEETF 2022 hosted by the Social Engineering Experts. I played this together under 3_Blind_Mice, a random team made together with @chuayupeng and ethon for pure fun and memes.
Like all the other smart-contract challenges in this CTF, a vulnerable contract was deployed onto SEETF&amp;rsquo;s very own private blockchain network.
Solving this challenge required knowing a concept in blockchain &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; that private variables in a contract are technically public and still readable, and also understanding the difference between tx.</description>
